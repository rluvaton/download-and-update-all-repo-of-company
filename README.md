# Download and update all repos of company

## Usage

Run `clone-app.sh` to clone all (up to 1000) repos of your company (and update them locally if exists)

Run `update-all.sh` to update locally all the repos of your company

> ⚠️ When those scripts updating local repos they will:
>
> 1. Remove any local changes
> 2. remove Local branches that doesn't exist on remote anymore

these script are currently needed to be run manually but you can create automatice scripts to run them (if you do, don't forget to share!)

## Why

I done this to be able to search all the repos of my company as GitHub search is very bad
